Let's imagine the Q-learning algorithm from the above temporal difference equation, which includes $\\max_{a}q(s_{t+2}, a)$. If the Q-learning estimates the following the value of the greedy policy, the acting greedy would not explore sufficiently all the time so that we can imagine the variance will be not better.

    "> The epsilon-greedy selection can be said to belong to the uniformly random policy. The uniformly random policy has the disadvantage of choosing equally among all actions, although it is an effective means of balancing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning. In other words, it means that it is as likely to select the worst behaviour as it is to select the next best option. The softmax policy selection method [6] can be used to change the action probabilities as a graded function of the estimated value. Therefore, while the highest probability is chosen for the greedy actions, all remaining actions can be ranked and weighted according to value estimates so that the disadvantage can be removed. Thus, if the behaviour policy uses the softmax policy method, then the variance can be reduced.\n",
