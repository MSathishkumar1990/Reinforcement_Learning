1. Agent Implementation: Random, UCB, Epsilon-greedy and REINFORCE Agent.
Implemented four different kinds of experiment and analysed them.

2. Learning Algorithms for Sequential Decision Problems: Tabular Reinforcement Learning, TD Learning,
   Policy Iteration, Q-learning agents [General Q-learning, Sarsa, Expected Sarsa, Double Q-learning],
   and analysed each result.
3. Analysed Q-learning, Double Q-learning, and Target Q-learning
4. Off-policy Bellman Operators with Fuction Approximation and Analysed Each Results
